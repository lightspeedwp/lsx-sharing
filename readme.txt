== Description ==

= Works with the LSX Theme =
Our modern and lightweight [theme](https://lsdev.biz/lsx/) works perfectly with LSX Sharing, improving internal linking, website SEO and user experience!

= Free Companion Theme =

LSX Sharing is built for the free [LSX theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/lsx/) in the WordPress theme repository as the perfect companion for LSX Blocks.

= Block Editor Support =

The LSX theme is full compatible with the WordPress block editor. This means you can now make use of the drag-and-drop page builder when creating new pages and posts.

[LSX Blocks](https://lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/blocks) is an extension with blocks designed to display perfectly with the LSX theme. The blocks plugin extends various WordPress core blocks to be more flexible with the WordPress theme.

The combination of LSX Theme & LSX Blocks gives you a true page builder experience using the WordPress Gutenberg block editor.
